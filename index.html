      Ayy, it's me, Guatapuri!
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hey! I’m Daniel Dangond, but I go by Guatapuri online. I have a passion for
      video games and how they bring together many different artistic disciplines,
      and my hobbies are correspondingly all over the place. I play and write
      music, do 3D modeling, and, naturally, make games! Scroll to see some
      stuff I’ve worked on and current projects!

        <p class="projectDescription">
          Ascent is an experience I created as part of a team for the class
          2.S972 (Virtual Reality, Sound, and Cinema) at MIT, in collaboration
          with Berklee and Harvard. I was in charge of programming on this
          project and learned a lot about developing for VR through it. I also
          learned how to use FMOD (both FMOD Studio and the Unity integration)
          to bring in the music.

        <img src="assets/images/juSaber.png" alt="JuSaber" class="projectImage">
        <p class="projectDescription">
          JuSaber is a quick game I threw together on a 6-hour flight that takes
          maps from Beat Saber and plays them as if they were Jubeat maps. I had
          recently been in Japan and was disappointed that I could never find
          Japanese rhythm games in American arcades. I originally wanted to make
          a standard Jubeat emulator, but realized that I would then have to make
          my own maps in order to be able to enjoy and play it. That was out of
          scope for such a short flight, so I adapted by simply using Beat Saber
          maps and a 4x3 grid rather than the standard 4x4. This also turned out
          to be a good move as the smaller grid makes it easier to keep your
          fingers on the right place on the keyboard. Finally, Beat Saber maps
          turn out to be perfect for Jubeat-style play and are incredibly fun to
          play in this way. Since it is playable and I'm kinda busy with other
          things, I don't intend to develop it further in the forseeable future,
          but it would be nice to at least improve the interface at some point.

        <p class="projectDescription">
          Bottled Up is a game I worked on with a few friends for a hackathon
          at MIT called Reality Virtually. In it, you are placed in a small room
          with a collection of magical ingredients. You can use tools to prepare
          these ingredients into potions, and then brew them in a big cauldron.
          Using bottles, you can then bottle up the results and display them
          proudly! Unfortunately, there's a bug with rendering to the VR headset
          that is only present when building, so the only way to play this at
          the moment is to run it within Unity.

        <p class="projectDescription">
          Triple Beat is a rhythm game I developed for the July 2019 Summer Slow
          Jams game jam organized by Portland Indie Game Squad. The themes was
          "3-Button, 3-Color Games", and I took the opportunity to create an
          original rhythm game of my own. It has a strange control scheme due to
          limitations of the MacBook keyboard (it won't register pressing the up
          arrow, left arrow, and right arrow at the same time), but it's very
          playable and enjoyable. It only has one song included (which I wrote),
          but it also includes a built-in map editor which can be used to add
          more. I am quite proud of this game, as I put a lot of effort into
          the aesthetics, mechanics, and music, <em>especially</em> when compared to
          JuSaber. It was also my first solo game jam, and my first time creating
          an editor of any kind. Development went smoothly and I couldn't be
          happier with the result. Plus, it works on Mac, Windows, AND Linux!

          This is a research project I am working on at MIT. Within it, you can

          simulate and practice various scenarios you might encounter in a
          foreign country. At the moment, you can order food at a café or check
          in to a hotel. Unfortunately, this project cannot be shared widely at
          the moment due to requiring the installation of the gcloud SDK and my
          personal login information in order to access DialogFlow.
